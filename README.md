## Objective
Nowadays, many institutions provide a loan for society and many people interested to
use that facility. That is good news for those institutions because they can get more
interest from the borrower. But, hold your horses! Are you sure those applicants can pay
it well? The institution also needs to be careful to choose their credit recipient. Failed to
choose good credit recipient means a bigger tendency of those people to become default
and inflict loss for the company.
